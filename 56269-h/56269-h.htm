<h2>Authors’ Note</h2>

<p><i>It has long been the belief of the authors
that Love-making should be included
in the regular curriculum of our schools.
It seems to us the most important branch
of co-education.</i></p>

<p><i>How few of us know how to make love
properly, and how very few, after making
it, know how to keep it!</i></p>

<p><i>So much depends upon the kind of love
which is made. There are no artificial
methods of preserving love, but the best
kind will keep forever. Few beginners
know how to make the lasting kind, and
many, even, of those with vast experience
are still quite clumsy. The only way is to
keep at it.</i></p>

<p><i>We hope that this book will fill a long-felt
want. Surely of all long-felt wants the
want of love seems longest.</i></p>

<p><i>It is for the earnest student of True
Love that we have compiled this cyclopedia.</i></p>

<h2>A</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">A, the first letter, placed
by Cupid at the head
of his Alphabet, because
it stands for Amour,
Ardor, Art, Affinity,
Affection, Adoration,
Affability, Angel, etc.;
also A is the easiest
word to spell, with the exception of I.</p>

<p>The origin of the form of our capital
letter A is supposed to have been an
Egyptian symbol (see illustration) representing
two people engaged in the ancient
pastime called Kyssin, which survives
even at the present day. A, by many supposed
to be the oldest
of the alphabet and
constituting, as it does,
the initial of Adam’s
name, was doubtless
the only letter in existence
at the time Adam
learned to write.</p>

<p>The words Ark, Antediluvian, Ancestry,
Archæology, and Antiquity all support
the above theory.</p>

<p>Girls like Adelaide, Agatha, Agnes, Alice,
Althea, Amanda, Amy, Angelina, and
Arabella, whose initials fall in this letter
will be Attractive, Amiable, Artless, and in
the opposite sex most attracted by those of
Ardent, Ambitious, and Affable disposition.</p>

known as the Bee (see
illustration). Others
claim that its form is
copied from the curves
of Cupid’s Bow. In
either case its chief characteristic is
Busy-ness.</p>

<p>B is a letter beloved of all. Bashful,
Bouncing, Beautiful, and Bonny, all of
which pleasing attributes are the natural
inheritance of the girls to whose lot
the initial B shall

letters. It takes its
shape from the first
golden curl, given as a
Love Token by Cupid

found her again, after
their first quarrel, thus
originating the Society of Psychical Research

<p>C, being the initial of Cupid, has many
of his charming graces, being Careless,
Coquettish, Capricious, Clandestine,
Clinging, and Curious.</p>

<h2>D</h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-d.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">D The letter D dates from
about 967 B. C.</p>

<p>Hipopotamia, one of
Solomon’s many wives,
having been blessed
with no children, had
a little pet animal, presumably
much like the
modern <em>lap dog</em>, of which she was very
fond and was forever exclaiming of it,
“Isn’t it Dear!” or “Isn’t it a Darling!”
Solomon would invariably reply, “No,
Dog gone it!” and sometimes even, “No,
D—— it!” Then Hipopotamia would
smile, disclosing two very lovely Dimples.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus-d.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="D, as described in this passage" />
</div>

<p>Realizing the usefulness
of such words,
Solomon created the
letter D, in order to be
able to spell them. In
the hieroglyphics of the
times it was written as
this fragment will show,
the form being taken from Hipopotamia’s
little pet dog, Hydrophobia.</p>

<p>D has turned out to be one of the most
useful letters in Cupid’s Alphabet, beginning
as it does, Dearie, Ducky, Dreams,
Delight, Determination, and Desire. But
it has an unhappy side in Don’t, Disappointment,
and Despair.</p>

<p>The girls under this letter are all Darlings.

<div class="blockquote">

Elephant, the presence of “E” in E jaculation,
E xtraordinary, E gad, E normous,
is directly traceable to the close relation
of the letter to that popular pachyderm.</p>

<p class="dropcap">F The form of the letter
F was first discovered
on an ancient fragment
of pottery by a German
archæologist, in the
shape of a sandal on
what is supposed to be
the foot of Achilles. As
will be seen in the accompanying cut the
heel of the sandal and the part covering
what is known as the “tendon of Achilles”
is peculiarly designed for the protection

<p class="dropcap">Long, long ago, the
God of Love was supposed
to dwell in the
Moon and was called
Lameck (the Moon
God). From the sometimes
startling effect
moonlight had upon the
sentimental, it was believed that the moon-beams
were the arrows of the God of Love
(Cupid’s Arrows). Hence this symbol (see
cut) came to mean affection, and from it
came the letter L, ranking very high in
Cupid’s Alphabet, beginning, as it does,
the most important word in the history of
the world, Love. This
symbol was usually
found, as in Cupid’s
Alphabet, following the
symbol of Kubid, and
meaning that Love
follows in the path of
Cupid.</p>

<p>The neo-Babylonian characters are the

made up almost entirely of arrangements
of this symbol slightly conventionalized.</p>

Lucretia, Louise, and Lucinda, the
women under this sign, are Languid,
Luscious, Lackadaisical, and Loving;
while the men are usually named Lionel

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>:—It is interesting to note the
Chinese use of the same symbol surrounded
by tears <img src="images/sim.jpg" width="45" height="40" alt="Chinese symbol" />, pronounced sim,
meaning Heart.</p>

it of very ancient origin, as in the early
times the Amorites were the dominant
race of Syria and Canaan, which are
named on the oldest Babylonian monuments
“the land of the Amorites.” (See
map of Amouria.) There are plenty of
Amourites in the world to-day, but they
show not the slightest
desire to congregate,
but, quite to the contrary,
can be found
wandering off in pairs
at the slightest pretext.</p>

<p><i>Thursday</i>, a wonderful day, languorous
with the perfume of flowers. The
birds never sang so sweetly, the butterflies
never seemed so brilliant. The little
silver brook fell into the lake with so
soothing a sound and the
drowsy hum of the bee was
like a lullaby. Such a dreamy
contentment seemed to pervade
the whole Garden. Like
the breath of a rose a caressing
zephyr sighed overhead and
creaked ever so little the old
signboard nestled among the leaves. The
old signboard with this inscription in quaint
characters, “<i lang="la">Quamdiu se bene gesserit</i>.”
Adam looked up from where he lolled in
the soft grass and smiled as at an old
friend. He stretched and drew a deep
breath of content. The day seemed the
most wonderful he had known.</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>, Black Friday they called it
afterward, broke clear and bright, but on
the horizon great piles of black cloud and
far off the ominous muttering of thunder.
All nature seemed nervous and a-tremble.
The breeze was fitful and petulant and the
hush of some impending evil hung over
the Garden. The old signboard creaked
sharply. Poor Adam! (Poor Us!!!)
There confronting him was this word in

this symbol, <img src="images/t-pawn.jpg" width="75" height="80" alt="Tree-shaped symbol" /> the sign of
the usurer or pawn-shop.
This unquestionably establishes
our version of this garden
story. (<i>See S.</i>) The variation in
Adam’s way of writing the symbol is due
either to that extreme sense of delicacy
which would naturally make him wish
to disguise the unpleasant, or to sheer
laziness. He was such a poet.</p>

it! Some of them were so devoted to it
that they did it over and over again,
Solomon for instance. At times the rush
was so great that the
clerks in the Office
of Record would get
behind in their
work, and in their

to make the hole
in the wedding ring, showing the Bridegroom’s

<h2><i>AMORIA</i></h2>

<p class="center smaller">(<i>SEE MAP</i>)</p>


<p>Amoria is the most ancient and honorable
country upon the earth’s surface
and is without question the
most intensely populated. It is a green
and fertile country, and the principal
occupation of its people is hearticultural
husbandry. The form of government is
Home Rule, and to become a citizen,
although born in the country, it is required
that at least one complete journey be
made from end to end of the country’s
principal highway. This at first seems
an odd requirement, but there is good
reasoning behind it. First, as this great
highway, known as the Path of True
Love, in its devious windings touches
practically every portion of the kingdom—the
trip is likely to open the traveller’s
eyes and teach him much of the resources
and conditions of the country he wishes
to call his own. Second, as the road is
rough and in places sometimes seemingly
impassable, the trip will test the determination
and stability of the most hearty.</p>

<p>Turn to the map and we find Amoria
bounded on three sides by Misanthropia,
the State of Indifference, and the Sea of
Oblivion, emptying into which the Quarrel
River forever pours its flotsam and
jetsam. On the upper side you will see
it is bounded by the edge of the map; this
is because it is too cold in that direction to
sustain human life.</p>

Mount Curiosity—its snow-capped peaks
lost in the soft gray veil of mist that has
prevented the scientists from determining
its greatest heights. The ascent of the
mountain is usually made on the side
where it comes nearest to the State of Indifference
(<a href="#note-y" id="anch-y">see note Y</a>); here a well-worn
path, known as the Path of Least Resistance,
takes one by such a gradual and
agreeable route that little or no effort is
realized in the climb, and it is usually a
surprise when, just a little below the frost
line, one comes suddenly upon a little
plateau high, high, in the heavens. Here
the air is salubrious and the temperature
even. The view is so wonderful in the
early Dawn that the most phlegmatic will
become enthusiastic. This little plateau
is known as the Plateau Platonic and is
quite flat. In spite of its beauty and
charm few travellers are satisfied to rest
here long.</p>

<p>In leaving the plateau one must have a
care, for there are two paths quite similar
in appearance—one leading up the mountain
to nowhere and loneliness, and the
other the commencement of the Path of
True Love. The careful traveller need
not mistake the path, for beside the entrance,
at about the height of a man’s
heart and nailed to a great Oak, is a
crudely fashioned hand with finger pointing
the way. This is called the Hand of
Fate. Alas, too few take the trouble to
look for this guide, and many take the
wrong path; while those who, by sheer
luck, take the right one are easily discouraged
because of the very uncertain
condition of mind they soon find themselves
in. These usually lose heart before
going a great way, or in their careless
method of progress take some wrong turning
and come to a swift and bad end.</p>

<p>But we will follow the progress of the
traveller who believes in signs.</p>

<p>It is hard to describe those first impressions
as one comes swinging down
the mountainside and sees winding far out
and across the verdant Valley of Dreams,
dotted here and there with its picturesque
castles, the Path of True Love like a silver
thread. It seems so bright and pure, and
off to the right there is such a happy pink
glow in the sky, that one usually finds
himself humming some old love song.</p>

<p>Lucky the traveller who puts a clover
in his buttonhole, while crossing the Valley
of Dreams, for all too soon the cold
winds that sweep across Lake Indifference,
and make the trip around it a perilous
and discouraging one, will be chilling
his marrow. He will need both courage
and luck when, rounding the upper end of
the lake, he comes upon the rough and
rocky stretch of road running along the
edge of a fearful precipice which overhangs
the lake, and is known as the Height
of Indifference; here one false step and
all is lost. Past this danger the road
turns from the lake, but the traveller has
hardly time to congratulate himself upon
the warmer conditions when he is confronted
by a most disconcerting range of
mountains known as the Mountains of
Opposition. If you do not cross the
mountains the mountains will double cross
you, so push on and with tact and determination
they will be overcome.</p>

<p>The mountains passed, a smooth bit of
road is reached and brighter weather, that,
after the lowering clouds, the storms and
many obstacles met with in the mountains,
will likely mislead the traveller into
thinking his troubles over. Light-hearted
he will push forward hurriedly, taking
little heed of the fast increasing cold.
Fortunately, just at the edge of the map
and just upon the longitude of Respect,
the road takes a sudden sharp turn, but
it is almost from bad to worse, for it
plunges the traveller into the Forest of
Misunderstanding, a dark and dismal
place that will fill the strongest with misgivings.
The only way is to stick close to
the road. This is sometimes hard in the
darkness as there are many by-paths.
Travellers once off the correct road have
been known to wander for years without
once seeing the sunlight. About half way
through the forest there is a road turning
to the right; it seems the easier way, dipping
down, as it does, into a little valley
and across a turbulent little stream, beyond
which it disappears from sight in the
tangle of brilliant foliage covering Mount
Folly. Unhappy he who takes this turn,
for there is many a slippery stone in the
bed of this stream and the crossing is not a
happy one. If one would turn back at the
first slip, but human nature is stubborn
and few do; besides there seems little
choice between the dismal forest behind
and the lure of Mt. Folly ahead. Folly
lasts but a day, however, and the foliage
soon loses its attractive coloring. The
foolish wayfarer then pushing on finds
himself again confronted by the turbulent
stream, but easier to cross this time. A
little way further the path ends at what
appears to be a refreshing spring; it is
the Spring of Untruth, and he who lies
to drink of its waters will ever be a slave
of the drug.</p>

<p>Again as one is nearing the edges of the
Black Forest is another road leading off
to the left and to the Spring of Mistrust.
Turn not aside nor drink of this spring;
its waters are bitter and this turning but
takes one back into the depths of the dismal
forest.</p>

<p>Emerging from the Black Forest of
Misunderstanding the road winds across
a fertile and easy-going prairie land, twice
crossing the acid waters of Bicker Brook
(<a href="#note-23" id="anch-23">see note 23</a>), and crossing the Quarrel
River takes its course along the foot of
what, by many, is considered the most
beautiful mountain in Amoria, Mount
Unselfishness. The going is easy here,
and when one comes to a little road
branching off and running right up the
mountain side he is apt to feel very little
inclination to take it. Nearly every traveller
knows by hearsay that this is a
short-cut one should take, but standing
at the foot of the mountain, with a broad
smooth road on one hand and this little
used difficult mountain path (it is hardly
more than a blazed trail) on the other,
it is much to the traveller’s credit who
attempts it at all. Quite a few do, however,
begin the ascent, but almost without
exception have not the strength to
continue and turn back to the main highway,
only to be shortly plunged again
and again in the cold and caustic waters
of the Quarrel River as the road crosses
and recrosses it. There are no bridges
here, and many a poor traveller becoming
exhausted in the mad battle with the current
hopelessly loses all self-control and
is carried away to be lost in the Sea of
Oblivion. At the river’s mouth is Lost
Hope Island; this is really nothing more
than a bar, and superstition has it that
there, on stormy nights when the tide is
coming in, congregate those poor lost
souls, and it is claimed, on good authority,
that the discords of their mournful songs
can be heard even as far as to the edges of
the Desert of Absence.</p>

<p>After these several crossings of the
Quarrel River the road again becomes
easy and travel should be a pleasure, but
the traveller is weary from the recent
struggle with the river, and is almost
thankful for the flat stretch of road where
it first crosses the Desert of Absence. It
were often better if this bit of road were
longer, for before the traveller entirely regains
his former vim he is deep in the
unhealthy mists and quicksands of the
Slough of Despond, and it is in a very
weakened condition that he commences
the second crossing of the Desert of Absence.
In this condition is it strange that
one loiter in the Oasis of Flirtation—the
one bright spot in an otherwise dull
desert? But an oasis and a flirtation have
their limits, and when one’s thirst is satisfied
one wants to move on. And well
this is for the traveller on the Path of True
Love, for only a little and the desert is
passed, and the road leads for many happy
miles through the sweetest and most
beautiful meadow land where the warm
sunlight, the songs of the birds, and the
sweet odor of new-mown hay repay one
for all the hardships of the past, and so
stimulate the traveller that he strikes out
upon the third crossing of the Desert of
Absence with a light step and a song in his
heart, and though the trip is longer it
seems far shorter than either of the previous
crossings. So happy indeed has he
been and, with the soft airs of the desert
making his heart grow fonder, the way
seems so easy that the sudden obstruction
of two of the lesser spurs of the Mountains
of Opposition fill him with misgiving,
and the valley between them is well
named Blue Valley. (<a href="#note-13" id="anch-13">See note 13.</a>)</p>

<p>In such a condition of mind the traveller
plunges down the mountain side and is
soon deep in a great gloomy forest, not
likely to raise his spirits, but rather calculated
to depress them still more.</p>

<p>Imagine then the elation when bursting
at length from the depression of the Forest
of Gloom the traveller sees before him
that transcendently beautiful mountain,
Mount Hope. Well may he hold his
breath and gaze in rapture, for before him
rises the most beautiful mountain in all
the world and will ever be as long as life
lasts. With its velvety slopes and shaded
dells, its little silver rills tinkling down the
mountain side, sounding like fairy laughter
through the trees, the gently stirring
air freighted with the perfume of myriads
of fragrant blossoms, and over all a tender
rose-colored glow reflected from the soft
pinky clouds that forever tenderly rest
upon the mountain’s top, it is indeed the
most beautiful of nature’s jewels. So it
seems, with Hope so long deferred, to that
tired-eyed struggler upon Love’s Highway,
often heartsick and oppressed by the
vicissitudes of the way, for here he may
rest and, gazing again out over the dear
Valley of Dreams, rejuvenate the Yearning,
the Ambition, and the Determination
that have brought him through so much.</p>

<p>To these he may now add Hope, and so
equipped and refreshed he dashes a second
time through the Forest of Gloom, and
though confronted by the most stubborn
and rocky section (known as the Parent
Peak) in the entire range of the Mountains
of Opposition, his past experience and his
added strength carry him over with little
effort, and, coming down the last steep
slope, his heart gives a bound as his eye
follows the smooth roadway stretching
invitingly across a nearly level expanse of
well-cultivated country thickly dotted with
the happy homes of those who had once
been travellers like himself. If he be not
short-sighted, he is able to see even as far
ahead as to where the road and his lonely
journey end in heavenly Mount Heart’s
Desire. As he passes along many a
cheerful face smiles out at him from the
doorways, and many a cheerful word of
welcome and greeting encourages him to
hasten. The smiles of the rosy-cheeked
children seem especially sweet to him.</p>

<p>The journey’s end! The goal is
reached! Naught remains further for
the traveller now except the Oath of Allegiance
which is performed with considerable
ceremony in the little church just
around the corner to the left.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>:—Mount Heart’s Desire is of an attractive shape
and thickly surrounded by orange blossoms. No two
travellers agree as to its height, but we are of the opinion
that it <em>must</em> be about five feet, three or four inches. Within
it is a little shrine called Trust, which it is the duty of every
worshipper to protect.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a href="#anch-y" id="note-y"><span class="smcap">Note Y.</span></a> It seems more than mere coincidence that the
Path of Least Resistance should run up Mount Curiosity
on the side nearest to the borders of the State of Indifference,
and there is a very ancient tradition that the first
person to make the ascent came from that easy-going
country.</p>

<p>We believe this tradition to be another version of the
Adam and Eve story, and feel that it conclusively proves
us right in our calculations as to the exact location of the
Garden of Eden. We claim it was situated in that part
of the State of Indifference near to and in full view of Mount
Curiosity, and that Adam was the first man to make the
climb. We also believe that Adam became lost on the
mountainside and never returned to Eden, and that the
Path of True Love gives a pretty good idea of his subsequent
wanderings, of which so little heretofore has been
known.</p>

<p>At any rate, vast numbers from the State of Indifference
make the ascent of Mount Curiosity every year, and many
of our best citizens have come from that state.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a href="#anch-23" id="note-23"><span class="smcap">Note 23.</span></a> At this point, after the more or less extended
journey through the unhealthy Forest of Misunderstanding,
the traveller must have a care, especially if he be of a sensitive
nature, for the shock of the first plunge through Bicker
Brook will often throw one into a distemper or fever.
Some, going absolutely out of their heads, wander far afield.
Herein lies a grave danger because of the nearness of the
road at this point to the boundaries of Misanthropia, which
state is little more than a barren waste. The peculiar
mental attitude of its inhabitants gives strength to the
theory advanced in Amoria that its population is made up
of those poor fever-ridden souls who have wandered from
the Path of True Love and gone quite mad.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a href="#anch-13" id="note-13"><span class="smcap">Note 13.</span></a> The higher one climbs the duller the thud.
So with the traveller who has been dreaming across sweet
meadow land and balmy wastes when suddenly confronted
by a renewal of obstacles which his optimism had made
him believe passed forever, and it is in a nervous and uncertain
state of mind we find him groping his way through
the mists that always fill Blue Valley. Here is a great
danger, for with the steep mountains on three sides the
traveller, if he once stumble from the road, is apt to follow
the depression of the valley until morbid and benumbed
he wander into the State of Indifference.</p>

<p>The same danger, in a lesser degree, is lurking in the Forest
of Gloom.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
